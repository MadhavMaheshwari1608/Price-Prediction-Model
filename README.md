<h1 style="text-align: center;">Price Prediction</h1>

### Background:
In today's digital era, online marketplaces have become an integral part of our lives. With the convenience of browsing through a vast array of products and making purchases from the comfort of our homes, online shopping has experienced exponential growth. these virtual shopping havens offer a seemingly endless array of products at our fingertips. However, amidst this vast ocean of choices, finding the perfect product at the best price can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.This assignment sets out on an exhilarating journey to create such a companionâ€”a cutting-edge recommendation and price prediction model that will revolutionize the online shopping experience.

### Problem statement:
The aim is to build a model that can give recommendations and price prediction for various products on online marketplace by utilising the data about prices on existing online platforms.

- **Data Collection:**: There are 2 ways you can go about it. We suggest working with a Kaggle Dataset initially, though if you're comfortable with web scraping, you can try that track instead. Web Scraping also gives you insights into how you can clean and prepare data, like most real-life machine learning problems, so if you want the whole experience, you can try that too.
   - **Web Scraping**
      1. **Website Selection**: Select from which websites to fetch price information for products. Choose a store that provides a well-structured and readily available set of data. Determine what you are looking for, either in the products or categories.
      2. **Scraping**: To retrieve prices of products from the selected online stores, use web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. To navigate a website's HTML structure, find price elements and fetch relevant information, you will need to write code.
      3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Cleanse the scraped data by removing inconsistencies, formatting issues, or special characters. The missing values and outliers must be dealt with appropriately. You can convert your data into a structured format that's suitable for analysis,
   such as a spreadsheet or database.
   - **Kaggle Dataset Selection**: If you aren't comfortable with scraping, you can check out <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle's datasets</a> and try to find one which suits your needs!
 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis-EDA(  Bonus Task):** Explore the scraped data to gain insights and understand the
distribution of prices. Calculate the total statistics, such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum prices. To determine the patterns or outliers, you can visualize your figures by means of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/histogram.asp#:~:text=Investopedia%20%2F%20Joules%20Garcia-,What%20Is%20a%20Histogram%3F,into%20logical%20ranges%20or%20bins.">histograms</a>, <a href="https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/what-is-a-box-plot/">box graphs</a> and <a href="https://chartio.com/learn/charts/what-is-a-scatter-plot/">scatter plots</a>.

- **Model Selection and Training**: Choose a suitable machine learning model for price prediction, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/JTj-WgWLKFM">linear regression</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wxS5P7yDHRA">decision trees</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/x9pIM2GkbF4">random forests</a>. Split the data into training and testing sets. In view of product characteristics as inputs and corresponding prices being the target variable, train a selected model with training data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using <a href = "https://youtu.be/K490SP-_H0U">appropriate metrics</a> like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE). To evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability, a comparison between expected prices and actual prices from testing data can be made.

- **Deployment and Price Recommendations:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, create an interface or application where users can input product attributes, such as brand, category, and features. To generate price recommendations based on these attributes, implement a model. Ensuring that the interface is user-friendly as well as providing sufficient and meaningful recommendations.
